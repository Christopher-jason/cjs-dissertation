# Meme Stocks and Market Dynamics: Studying the Influence of r/wallstreetbets on the Stock Market

Dissertation project for the Master of Algorithmic Trading.

This dissertation explores the impact of the internet community, Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, on the stock market. Utilizing sentiment analysis and data processing techniques, this study aims to understand how the popularity and discussion of certain companies within the meme community influence stock prices. The data collected from Reddit is analysed with sentiment analysis models such as FinBERT, VADER, RoBERTa, and GPT-3.5, a large language model. These scores are then combined with market data such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume(OHLCV) and are used as inputs for neural network models - LSTM and CNN. These models were used to observe if the sentiment analysis could provide us with any indication of how the returns of the stock are affected from one day to one week.
